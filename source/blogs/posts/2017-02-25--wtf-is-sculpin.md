Sculpin is a PHP based static site generator. And WTF are static site genertors? They are great for content that doesn’t need to be updated by multiple users on a regular basis i.e. a static website. They can remove much of the complexity that comes with a CMS as well as a need for server side technologies like PHP or a datbase server. It’s great for my personal blog, but not ideal from a large news organization that has much more dynamic content. Sculpin also has the advantage of being written in a language I’m already familiar with. Some of the standout features of Sculpin include:
* Writing content on markdown
* Twig based templating
* Extremely fast
* Secure
* Can host static sites from github
