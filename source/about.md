# About Me

I have been been working with Drupal for about 6 years, and been building web applications for over 10. I've worked with Drupal at an enterprise level for the last 3 years, helping create some amazing websites. I'm passionate about building relationships with my clients and working together to achieve business goals. 

When I'm not behind the computer I love running, soccer, and traveling. In my spare time I'm an active member of the SC Drupal User group, the Augusta Linux User Group, and getting together for some beer and bytes.
